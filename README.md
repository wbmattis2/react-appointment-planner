# react-appointment-planner

A Codecademy Challenge Project by Benny Mattis

##Description

This is the result of a guided Challenge Project included on Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer and Front-End Engineer career paths. Its ultimate purpose is to demonstrate my abilities with the popular JavaScript library, React. The app functions as a simple planner, allowing users to add contacts and appointments.

##Features

The app notifies users when they have entered a name that has already been saved to the planner's contacts, and alerts the user again if they attempt to save such a duplicate. When planning an appointment, users can associate the appointment with a contact among those that have been saved in the planner. The program employs stateful and stateless React function components to achieve the desired result.

##How to Use

First, download the contents of the repository and store those contents in a folder. Ensure you have (installed Node Package Manager)[https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-node-locally], then navigate to the folder containing the project using your command line interface. Enter the command `npm install` and wait for the package manager to finish executing that command. Finally, enter the command `npm start`. The app should open in a new browser tab or window. If the app does not open automatically, try using your web browser to navigate to http://localhost:3000.

##Technologies

This app was made with React.
