# react-appointment-planner

A Codecademy Challenge Project by Benny Mattis

##Description

This is the result of a guided Challenge Project included on Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer and Front-End Engineer career paths. Its ultimate purpose is to demonstrate my abilities with the popular JavaScript library, React. The app functions as a simple planner, allowing users to add contacts and appointments.

##Features

The app notifies users when they have entered a name that has already been saved to the planner's contacts, and alerts the user again if they attempt to save such a duplicate. When planning an appointment, users can associate the appointment with a contact among those that have been saved in the planner. The program employs stateful and stateless React function components to achieve the desired result.

##How to Use

Ensure you have Node Package Manager installed, then navigate to the folder containing my project using your command line interface. Enter the command "npm install", then enter the command "npm start". The app should open in a new browser tab or window. 

##Technologies

This app was made with React.

##Special Thanks
